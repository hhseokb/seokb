It is no secret that in Silicon Valley and around the world there is a huge shortage of developers. However, one reason there is this “shortage” is because most companies either want a Computer Science (CS) grad or someone with 10 years of experience who knows every single language. This puts beginner developers who are learning on their own in a tough spot. To get a job, they either have to create something super fancy that gets attention or keep learning for a much longer time (years) until they are “qualified” to even interview for one of these jobs – and even then, they might not have the right amount of “experience”.

I guess this makes sense. After all, it is reasonable for companies to want only the best developers. However, in a time where is a HUGE crunch in developers, these standards seem to be getting more relaxed and there is a new crop of training courses for beginners popping up that train and then possibly place them into jobs. Here are a few to watch:

### CodeSchool

[Code School](http://www.codeschool.com/) is an online school for those who are starting programming. Students who have done really well in these courses have been known to receive job offers.

### San Francisco Dev Bootcamp

[Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) is a 10-week full-time program in San Francisco for brand new or experienced programmers that is focused on Ruby on Rails. The program costs $12,200 with discounts if you can pay up front or if you're a woman. Dev Bootcamp is set up to resemble an actual work environment, so you learn by doing and working in teams, not by sitting back and listening to lectures. At the end of the program, you will have interviews lined up for you with companies that use Ruby on Rails, and if you get a job through the program, you get $5,000 of your tuition back.

### New York Hacker School

[Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/) is a three-month full-time school in New York for becoming a better programmer. There are no grades, teachers, or formal curriculum. You choose a project to work on and work on it - you just need to check in at the beginning of the day and talk about what you worked on the previous day and what you're planning on working on today. Hacker School is free to attend (except for the tiny fact that you get no salary for 3 months and have to live in New York), but they do try to place you into a job after you graduate - they make money from the nice $20,000 recruiting fee.

### Chicago Code Academy (Now Starter League)

[Code Academy](http://www.codeacademy.org/) is an 11-week program in Chicago teaching beginners how to build web applications with Ruby on Rails. Code Academy also offers HTML / CSS and User Experience classes. The Ruby on Rails classes are either on Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 8am - 11:20am or Tuesday and Thursday from 8am to 1pm, so this is not a full-time environment, and the tuition is $6,000\. Code Academy does not seem to do much job placement, like Hacker School or Dev Bootcamp, as they are geared more toward people who want to build startups or their own websites. However, you do get exposure to the Chicago tech community during the experience and they are well-known in the Chicago developer community, so if you were looking for a job at the end of the program, you could probably get one by networking with the community.

### D.C. Hungry Academy

[Hungry Academy](http://hungryacademy.com/) is a 5-month program in Washington, D.C. run by LivingSocial that teachers beginners Ruby on Rails and prepares them to join the LivingSocial engineering team upon completion for an 18-month commitment. That's right, you get PAID a salary to learn and you get a job at Living Social if you complete the program. This program has only been offered once, but I really hope LivingSocial will continue to offer it in the future, as it is a truly irresistible offer.

## Conclusion

You no longer need an expensive Computer Science degree (or incredible self-taught hacker skills) to get a job as a developer. These Hacker Schools offer training on material you'll actually use during work - not all the extra stuff that's covered in a normal 4-year Computer Science program  - and companies are already looking at these alternative hacker schools as the developer talent crunch continues. We live in incredible times, take advantage of these opportunities.

## Update

Also, check out these Hacker Schools that popped up since I wrote this post:

### App Academy

[App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io/) is a nine week Ruby on Rails course in San Francisco very similar to Dev Bootcamp. You don't have to pay anything up front, but if you get a job after graduation, you have to pay 12.5% of your starting salary payable over the first 6 months after you start working.

### HackBright

[Hackbright Academy](http://www.hackbrightacademy.com/) is a 10-week full-time Python course in San Francisco specifically for women. After the course, the women are given job and internship opportunities not only as software engineers, but project managers and other roles in the tech community.

### Hack Reactor

[Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com/) is a new full-time 12-week JavaScript-focused course in San Francisco. They're still undecided on the tuition, and they will provide job opportunities to the students at the end of the program.
