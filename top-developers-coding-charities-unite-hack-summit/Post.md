We’ve spent the last few months quietly working hard to bring you a very special event -- hack.summit(), a virtual conference for programmers, at [http://hacksummit.org](http://hacksummit.org).

On December 1-4, 2014, an unprecedented line-up of programmers will take the digital stage.  The creators of Ruby on Rails, CSS, Google Glass, the Java language spec, Agile, Extreme Programming, Test Driven Development, Heroku, Spark, Bittorrent, UML, the Wiki, and many more are speaking.

They are rallied together to educate you.  But you won’t pay them (or us) to hear their words of wisdom.  Instead, all ticket sales go to coding non-profits, such as ones that help [support microfinance](http://coderstrust.com/) in Bangladesh, [teach computer science to underprivileged students](https://www.scripted.org/), and [drive inclusivity and diversity](http://code2040.org/) in the coding space.

hack.summit() is one hundred percent online, making it completely accessible to developers all over the world.  This means that it can operate on an unprecedented magnitude, both in attendee capacity and in the pedigree of its participants: almost all of our speakers would be a keynote at another event, but they’ve all rallied around our nonprofit partners to support the broader programming community.

To get a ticket, just visit [http://hacksummit.org](http://hacksummit.org), select a preferred coding nonprofit, and then set the value of the donation.  Attendees who are unable to donate can also receive a free ticket by spreading the word via Twitter and Facebook, which helps us find more donors.

We’ve partnered up with Tom Chi, co-creator of Google Glass who is an official advisor of hack.summit().  We’re also partnered Crowdcast.io, which layers on top of Google+ Hangouts, and allows attendees to ask and answer questions and meet their programming idols.

Physical conferences cost money and require travel; their logistics impede efficiency and attendee access.  We see ourselves as stewards of the virtual conference space, and hope that others will be inspired to create events like this in the future.
